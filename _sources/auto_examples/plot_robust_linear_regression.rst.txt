Robust linear model example
===========================

In this example with simulate a linear regression model with 1000 samples and
5 features. The simulated data is contaminated by 20% of outliers, in the form
of sparse sample intercepts (thus only on 20% of samples).

We illustrate the estimated linear regression weights and sample intercepts
obtained by the ``RobustLinearRegression`` learner, where we also compute the
false discovery proportion and power of the method for the multi-test problem of
outliers detection.
Note that the penalization level ``C_sample_intercepts`` of the sample
intercepts should be chosen as n_samples / noise_level, where noise_level is
obtained by a robust estimation of the noise's standard deviation.
We simply use here the `tick.inference.std_iqr` estimator.

Note that we don't use penalization on the model weights here, while other
penalizations are available, by changing the ``penalty`` parameter and by
giving a ``C`` value for the level of penalization.
Default is ``penalty='l2'``, namely ridge penalization, while ``penalty='l1'``
or ``penalty='slope'`` can be used when the number of features is large.
