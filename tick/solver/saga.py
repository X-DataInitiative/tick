class SAGA(SolverFirstOrderSto):
    """Stochastic Average Gradient solver, for the minimization of objectives
    of the form

    .. math::
        \\frac 1n \\sum_{i=1}^n f_i(w) + g(w),

    where the functions :math:`f_i` have smooth gradients and :math:`g` is
    prox-capable. Note that :class:`SAGA <tick.solver.SAGA>` works only
    with linear models, see :ref:`linear_model` and :ref:`robust`, where all
    linear models are listed.
    Function :math:`f = \\frac 1n \\sum_{i=1}^n f_i` corresponds
    to the ``model.loss`` method of the model (passed with ``set_model`` to the
    solver) and :math:`g` corresponds to the ``prox.value`` method of the
    prox (passed with the ``set_prox`` method).
    One iteration of :class:`SAGA <tick.solver.SAGA>` corresponds to the
    following iteration applied ``epoch_size`` times:

    .. math::
        \\begin{align*}
        w &\\gets \\mathrm{prox}_{\\eta g} \\Big(w - \\eta \\Big(\\nabla f_i(w)
         - \\delta_i + \\frac 1n \\sum_{i'=1}^n \\delta_{i'} \\Big) \\Big) \\\\
        \\delta_i &\\gets \\nabla f_i(w)
        \\end{align*}

    where :math:`i` is sampled at random (strategy depends on ``rand_type``) at
    each iteration, and where :math:`\\bar w` and :math:`\\nabla f(\\bar w)`
    are updated at the beginning of each epoch. The step-size :math:`\\eta` can be
    tuned with ``step``, the seed of the random number generator for generation
    of samples :math:`i` can be seeded with ``seed``. The iterations stop
    whenever tolerance ``tol`` is achieved, or after ``max_iter`` epochs
    (namely ``max_iter`` :math:`\\times` ``epoch_size`` iterates).
    The obtained solution :math:`w` is returned by the ``solve`` method, and is
    also stored in the ``solution`` attribute of the solver.

    Internally, :class:`SAGA <tick.solver.SAGA>` has dedicated code when
    the model is a generalized linear model with sparse features, and a
    separable proximal operator: in this case, each iteration works only in the
    set of non-zero features, leading to much faster iterates.

    Parameters
    ----------
    step : `float`
        Step-size parameter, the most important parameter of the solver.
        Whenever possible, this can be automatically tuned as
        ``step = 1 / model.get_lip_max()``. Otherwise, use a try-an-improve
        approach

    tol : `float`, default=1e-10
        The tolerance of the solver (iterations stop when the stopping
        criterion is below it)

    max_iter : `int`, default=10
        Maximum number of iterations of the solver, namely maximum number of
        epochs (by default full pass over the data, unless ``epoch_size`` has
        been modified from default)

    verbose : `bool`, default=True
        If `True`, solver verboses history, otherwise nothing is displayed,
        but history is recorded anyway

    seed : `int`, default=-1
        The seed of the random sampling. If it is negative then a random seed
        (different at each run) will be chosen.

    epoch_size : `int`, default given by model
        Epoch size, by default, this is automatically tuned using
        information from the model object passed through ``set_model``.

    rand_type : {'unif', 'perm'}, default='unif'
        How samples are randomly selected from the data

        * if ``'unif'`` samples are uniformly drawn among all possibilities
        * if ``'perm'`` a random permutation of all possibilities is
          generated and samples are sequentially taken from it. Once all of
          them have been taken, a new random permutation is generated

    print_every : `int`, default=1
        Print history information every time the iteration number is a
        multiple of ``print_every``. Used only is ``verbose`` is True

    record_every : `int`, default=1
        Save history information every time the iteration number is a
        multiple of ``record_every``

    n_threads : `int`, default=1
        Number of threads to use for parallel optimization. The strategy used
        for this is asynchronous updates of the iterates.

    Attributes
    ----------
    model : `Model`
        The model used by the solver, passed with the ``set_model`` method

    prox : `Prox`
        Proximal operator used by the solver, passed with the ``set_prox``
        method

    solution : `numpy.array`, shape=(n_coeffs,)
        Minimizer found by the solver

    history : `dict`-like
        A dict-type of object that contains history of the solver along
        iterations. It should be accessed using the ``get_history`` method

    time_start : `str`
        Start date of the call to ``solve()``

    time_elapsed : `float`
        Duration of the call to ``solve()``, in seconds

    time_end : `str`
        End date of the call to ``solve()``

    dtype : `{'float64', 'float32'}`, default='float64'
        Type of the arrays used. This value is set from model and prox dtypes.
