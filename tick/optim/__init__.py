# TODO: add notebooks for each models : PoissonReg, CoxPartial, Hawkes, that illustrates simulation and inference of the models, and compares solvers for each models

# TODO: add scipy's BGFS solver (that don't take a prox) that has the same API as our Solver (history can be done using the callbak in scipy.optim.bgfs)
