class SimuPoissonProcess(SimuPointProcess):
    """Homogeneous Poisson process simulation

    Parameters
    ----------
    intensities : `float` or a `np.ndarray`
        The intensities of the poisson process. If float this Poisson process
        has one node, otherwise it is multidimensional

    end_time : `float`, default=None
        Time until which this point process will be simulated

    max_jumps : `int`, default=None
        Simulation will stop if this number of jumps in reached

    seed : `int`, default = None
        The seed of the random sampling. If it is None then a random seed
        (different at each run) will be chosen.

    verbose : `bool`, default=True
        If True, simulation information is printed

    Attributes
    ----------
    n_nodes : `int`
        The number of nodes of the point process

    end_time : `float`
        Time until which this point process has been simulated

    n_total_jumps : `int`
        Total number of jumps simulated

    timestamps : `list` of `np.ndarray`, size=n_nodes
        A list of n_nodes timestamps arrays, each array containing the
        timestamps of all the jumps for this node

    tracked_intensity : `list[np.ndarray]`, size=n_nodes
        A record of the intensity with which this point process has been
        simulated.
        Note: you must call track_intensity before simulation to record it

    intensity_tracked_times : `np.ndarray`
        The times at which intensity has been recorded.
        Note: you must call track_intensity before simulation to record it

    intensity_track_step : `float`
        Step with which the intensity has been recorded
