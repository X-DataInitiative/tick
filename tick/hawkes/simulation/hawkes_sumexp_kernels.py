    where
    
      - :math:`D` is the number of nodes
      - :math:`\mu_i(t)` are the baseline intensities
      - :math:`\phi_{ij}` are the kernels
      - :math:`dN_j` are the processes differentiates

    and with an exponential parametrisation of the kernels

    .. math::
        \\phi_{ij}(t) = \\sum_{u=1}^{U} \\alpha^u_{ij} \\beta^u
                       \\exp (- \\beta^u t) 1_{t > 0}

    where :math:`\\alpha^u_{ij}` are the intensities of the kernel and
    :math:`\\beta^u` its decays. The matrix of all :math:`\\alpha` is called
    adjacency matrix. Note that all nodes kernels share the same decays list.

    Parameters
    ----------
    baseline : `np.ndarray` or `list`
        The baseline of all intensities, also noted :math:`\mu(t)`. It might 
        be three different types:
        
        * `np.ndarray`, shape=(n_nodes,) : One baseline per node is given. 
          Hence baseline is assumed to be constant, ie. 
          :math:`\mu_i(t) = \mu_i`
        * `np.ndarray`, shape=(n_nodes, n_intervals) : `n_intervals` baselines 
          are given per node. This assumes parameter `period_length` is also 
          given. In this case baseline is piecewise constant on intervals of 
          size `period_length / n_intervals` and periodic.
        * `list` of `tick.base.TimeFunction`, shape=(n_nodes,) : One function 
          is given per node, ie. :math:`\mu_i(t)` is explicitely given.

    adjacency : `np.ndarray`, shape=(n_nodes, n_nodes, n_decays)
        Intensities of exponential kernels, also named :math:`\\alpha^u_{ij}`

    decays : `np.ndarray`, shape=(n_decays, )
        Decays of exponential kernels, also named :math:`\\beta^u`
        If a `float` is given, all decays are equal to this float

    end_time : `float`, default=None
        Time until which this point process will be simulated

    max_jumps : `int`, default=None
        Simulation will stop if this number of jumps in reached

    seed : `int`, default = None
        The seed of the random sampling. If it is None then a random seed
        (different at each run) will be chosen.

    force_simulation : `bool`, default = False
        If force is not set to True, simulation won't be run if the matrix of
        the L1 norm of kernels has a spectral radius greater or equal to 1 as
        it would be unstable

    Attributes
    ----------
    timestamps : `list` of `np.ndarray`, size=n_nodes
        A list of n_nodes timestamps arrays, each array containing the
        timestamps of all the jumps for this node

    n_decays : `int`
        Number of decays of the `HawkesSumExpKernel` , also noted :math:`U`

    simulation_time : `float`
        Time until which this point process has been simulated

    n_total_jumps : `int`
        Total number of jumps simulated

    tracked_intensity : `list[np.ndarray]`, size=n_nodes
        A record of the intensity with which this point process has been
        simulated.
        Note: you must call track_intensity before simulation to record it

    intensity_tracked_times : `np.ndarray`
        The times at which intensity has been recorded.
        Note: you must call track_intensity before simulation to record it

    intensity_track_step : `float`
        Step with which the intensity has been recorded
